# PhoneClaw Promotion Kit

Short copy, post templates, and positioning notes for sharing PhoneClaw.

## One-line positioning

Canonical (use this verbatim in launches, listings, and directory submissions — matches Docs/SEO_GEO_STRATEGY.md):

> PhoneClaw is a mobile-native local AI Agent framework for phones and edge devices. Its iOS runtime runs on-device models and native iOS Skills by default, and supports optional Mac Gateway remote inference for heavier local models.

English (short variant):

> PhoneClaw turns phones into local AI agent runtimes with on-device models, native mobile Skills, LiveLand, and optional Mac Gateway inference.

Chinese:

> PhoneClaw 把手机变成本地 AI Agent 运行时，提供端侧模型、原生移动端 Skills、LiveLand 和可选 Mac Gateway 推理。

## Short description

English:

> PhoneClaw brings local agent workflows to the phone: on-device Gemma inference, native mobile Skills, image understanding, voice interaction, HealthKit and Calendar queries, LiveLand, and explicit Web Search when realtime information is needed.

Chinese:

> PhoneClaw 把本地 Agent 带到手机：端侧 Gemma 推理、原生移动端 Skills、图片理解、语音交互、健康与日历查询、LiveLand，以及用户明确需要时的联网搜索。

## What to emphasize

- Phone as the local AI agent runtime.
- Fully offline local path with on-device models.
- Native mobile Skills with permission boundaries.
- Useful personal workflows: schedule, reminders, contacts, Health data, clipboard, images, voice, web search.
- LiveLand and LIVE mode as mobile-native interaction surfaces.
- Optional Mac Gateway for heavier local inference over LAN.
- Open source and buildable with Xcode.

## Product boundaries

- PhoneClaw focuses on phone-scale local agent workflows.
- Local inference and native Skills run on the device by default.
- Web Search, webpage reading, and Mac Gateway are explicit user-triggered capabilities.
- Native actions follow mobile OS permission boundaries.
- Mac Gateway data handling depends on the Mac-side provider selected by the user.

Show HN: PhoneClaw - a mobile-native local AI Agent framework

PhoneClaw is a mobile-native local AI Agent framework for phones and edge devices. Its iOS runtime runs on-device models and native iOS Skills by default, and supports optional Mac Gateway remote inference for heavier local models.

PhoneClaw runs inference and Skill calls on device. It is designed for practical phone workflows: calendar queries, reminders, contacts, HealthKit summaries, clipboard, image understanding, voice, LiveLand, and explicit Web Search.

The Skill system is file-driven: each capability is defined by SKILL.md and backed by permission-scoped native mobile tools.

## Demo scripts

### Calendar and free-time analysis

1. Ask: "What is on my calendar today?"
2. Ask: "How busy am I this week?"
3. Ask: "Find a free slot tomorrow afternoon."

Point to show: native Calendar access plus local summarization.

### Web Search and follow-up

1. Ask: "Search the web for today's AI news."
2. Ask: "Summarize the important ones in Chinese."
3. Ask: "Turn this into a short post."

Point to show: explicit realtime search, then local organization.

### Image understanding

1. Pick or take a photo.
2. Ask: "What are the key things in this image?"
3. Ask: "What should I do next?"

Point to show: multimodal reasoning on the phone.
